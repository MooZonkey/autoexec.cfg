This is my TF2 autoexec script I've been intermittently working on for the past 4 years.


*I make a new TF2 autoexec.cfg every year around december. I make minor improvements monthly. In 2016-2017 I had 57 editions to my autexec.  Just recently I started logging my change notes into a text document. Each year I make a more efficient and powerful config. My goal is to make my autoexec better than what it was in the previous year.
So far my 2017 autoexec is better than chris' maxframes config, and it continues to improve over time. I did a ton of research in order to make these scripts. I remember how it felt to only be getting around 15fps on average, and its one of the worst things to experience while gaming. That old toaster couldn't even handle minecraft using the optifine mod. In order to make my games playable I had to make my own autoexec scripts, and by doing this I gave my toaster the ability to get over 40fps. Over the coarse of nearly 4 years I've continued to create config files for both myself and friends in need. If you want to use my script then you'll have to promise me that you won't alter any code and continue to give me credit. If I already know you then then odds of me giving the script to you will be much higher.



I'll be using GitHub and Atom to improve my scripts from now on.
