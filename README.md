This is my TF2 autoexec script I've been intermittently working on for the past 4 years.


*I had 27 editions to my autexec in 2016-2017 alone.  Just recently I started logging my change notes into a text document. Each year I make a more efficient and powerful config. My annual goal is to make my autoexec even better than what it was in the previous year.
My autoexec is better than chris' maxframes config, and it continues to improve over time. I did a ton of research in order to make these scripts. I remember how it felt to only be getting around 25fps on average, and its one of the worst things to experience while gaming. That old toaster couldn't even handle minecraft using optifine. In order to make my games playable I had to make my own autoexec scripts. By doing this I made my toaster achieve well over 60fps. Over 4 years of work and I still continue to create config files for both myself and friends in need.

 --If you want to use my script then you'll have to promise me that you won't alter any code and continue to give me credit. If I already know you then then odds of me giving the script to you will be much higher.



I'll be using GitHub and Atom to improve my scripts from now on.
